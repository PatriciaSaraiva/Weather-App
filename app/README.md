## Technologies

This app takes advantage of the following technologies:

- JavaScript
- React
- CSS
- React Router
- Google Maps

## Status

This project is currently in development.

Users can add or remove locations and learn about the weather on those locations.

In the roadmap:

- Write unit tests
- Add linting tools
- Provide the option to change between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Move the locations cards around like a canvas
- Provide more relevant information such as weather warnings

## Reflection

- This is a side project which goal is to develop my knowledge and skills upon completion of the [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/en-GB/courses/web-development-course-full-time) Web development Full stack course.
- It will be also important to learn technologies/procedures not taught at the course such as:

  - Testing (Jest, Testing Library, Cypress)
  - CSS-in-JS (Styled Components, Emotion)
  - Containerization (Docker) and Orchestration (Kubernetes)
  - Static site generators (Next.js, Gatsby)
  - TypeScript

- So far this project has been a great learning experience and helped me to put some learned tools in one place while creating a very useful app.
- There were some obstacles such as:

  - Deciding about going for a global state management solution. I feel that I could have done this without Redux by choosing a more connected architecture and making use of the "lifting the state up" pattern. But as a learning project, it's also important to practice state management from various perspectives (global and local).
  - Couldn't make use of virtualizing/containerizing due to time constraints
  - The [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) api accepts longitude and latitude as mandatory inputs to obtain the weather but does not allow to use the location name. Therefore I had to find another API ([GeoDB Cities](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities/)) in order to get all possible locations and their latitude/longitude.
  - Persisting the cities that I added by the user could have been achieved with a backend/db but since there were no other requirements for a backend service, I decided to make use of Redux and save the relevant state in the users LocalStorage.
